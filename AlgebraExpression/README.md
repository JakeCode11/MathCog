This project targets for different strategy to manipulate algebraic expression.
Different strategies should be explored with appropriate tutoring functionality.

Expression term merge(Algebra trace generation):

Example 1:
y+y=> (1+1)*y(distributive) => 2*y(calc)

Example 2:
(2+y)+1 => (y+2)+1(commutative) => y+(2+1)(associative) => y+3(calc)

Example 3:
((2+y)+1)+y => ((y+2)+1)+y(commutative) => (y+(2+1))+y(associative)  => (y+3)+y(calc) 
=> (y+y)+3(associative) => ((1+1)*y)+3(distributive) => 2*y+3(calc)

Example 4:
((y+1)+x)-1 => (x+(y+1))-1(commutative) => ((x+y)+1)-1(associative)
=> (x+y)+(1-1)(associative) => (x+y)+0(calc) =>

Example 5:
(2*(2+y))+1 =>(4+2y)+1(distributive) => (2y+4)+1(commutative) 
=>2y+(4+1)(associative) =>2y+5(calc)



x+3 = 2-1
(-3)   (-3) 
Infer x = -1
