This cognitive tutor mainly contains three components from bottom to up: <a href="https://github.com/buptkang/CSharp.Logic">Logic Inference</a>, <a href="https://github.com/buptkang/Relation.Logic">Constraint Solving </a>, and Syntax Pattern Matching through Parsing expression grammar. If you need more background knowledge, please refer to <a href="http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/">Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach</a> and its corresponding <a href="https://code.google.com/p/aima-python/">source repo</a>.

##Getting Started##

1. Consider one algebra-and-geometry problem: Find the distance betweeen A(2,0) and B(5,4)? Check out unit test to prime this problem using internal relational semantics and automate reason this question and generate intermediate steps to solve this question? [Test.Problem01.cs](https://github.com/buptkang/MathCog/blob/master/MathCog/Test/Problem/Test.Problem01.cs).
