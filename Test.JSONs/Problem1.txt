Input Drag: B(7,4) | B(7,4)
Explanation Drag: distance | Computing the distance between two points in the plane is an application of the Pythagorean Theorem for right triangles. The distance formula between two points (x0,y0) and (x1,y1) is d^2 = (x0-x1)^2 + (y0-y1)^2. | The distance formula between two points (x0,y0) and (x1,y1) is d^2 = (x0-x1)^2 + (y0-y1)^2.

Problem Solver:
Fact  Point: A(2,3)
Fact  Point: B(7,4)
Fact  DISTANCE:default=(A,B)
